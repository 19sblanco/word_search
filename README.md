# wordSearch
a word search application through the Book of Mormon and other scripture for my dad.

Input: Text file, Boolean expression
Output: occurances in the textfile where the boolean expression is satasfied within a given range of words

Example: If the text file was the Book of Mormon and the Boolean espression was (Nephi and Lehi). The output of this program would be every occurance 
in the Book of Mormon where Nephi was found within a given range of the word Lehi.
